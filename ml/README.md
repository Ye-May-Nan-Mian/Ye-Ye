You can download and unzip shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat from [here](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2), and you must install python and dlib before using dlib to detect face. However, for backend, you must move shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat to "/backend/". 

We don't train the neural network ourselves, because there are already good enough open models (e.g. dlib) for us to use, and we don't have enough data to train a good enough network. 

So, this catalog is empty.
